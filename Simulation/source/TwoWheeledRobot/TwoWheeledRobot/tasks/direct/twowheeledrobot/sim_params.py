"""
Shared simulation and actuator constants for the two-wheeled robot.

Purpose:
    Keep Isaac physics timing, ground contact, damping, solver, CyberGear,
    and DDSM115 constants in one importable Python module.

Edit here when:
    You need to change global simulation fidelity, ground friction, solver
    settings, or DDSM115/CyberGear constants used by the Isaac environments.

Avoid changing here without also checking:
    LQR physical parameters in residual_lqr_env.py, scripts/lqr_control.py,
    scripts/calculate_lqr_gains.py, and hardware scaling in
    scripts/uart_policy_runner.py.


Timing
------
  PHYSICS_DT      — PhysX time step (seconds)
  CONTROL_DECIMATION — physics steps per controller call
  → control / sensor sample time = PHYSICS_DT * CONTROL_DECIMATION  (20 ms)

Ground
------
  GROUND_STATIC_FRICTION   — static  friction coefficient
  GROUND_DYNAMIC_FRICTION  — dynamic friction coefficient
  GROUND_RESTITUTION       — bounciness (0 = none)

Robot body
----------
  LINEAR_DAMPING           — linear  velocity damping on all links
  ANGULAR_DAMPING          — angular velocity damping on all links

Actuators
---------
  DDSM115_*                 — DDSM115 current/torque/speed motor model
  WHEEL_DRIVE_STIFFNESS    — PhysX stiffness for effort-controlled wheel joints
  CYBERGEAR_STIFFNESS      — default CyberGear position gain in simulation
  CYBERGEAR_DAMPING        — default CyberGear damping gain in simulation

Solver
------
  SOLVER_POSITION_ITERS    — PhysX position solver iterations (higher = stiffer)
  SOLVER_VELOCITY_ITERS    — PhysX velocity solver iterations
